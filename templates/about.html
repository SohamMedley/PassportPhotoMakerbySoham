                <h2>Our Story</h2>
                <p>PassportPro was founded in 2023 with a simple mission: to make creating passport photos easy, affordable, and accessible to everyone.</p>
                <p>After experiencing the frustration of getting passport photos taken at traditional photo studios, our founders decided to create a solution that leverages modern technology to simplify the process.</p>
                <p>Today, PassportPro serves thousands of users across India, helping them create perfect passport photos that meet all official requirements without leaving their homes.</p>
                
                <h2>Our Technology</h2>
                <p>PassportPro uses advanced AI technology to automatically remove backgrounds from photos and replace them with appropriate colors that meet passport requirements.</p>
                <p>Our system is designed to ensure that all photos meet the specific requirements for Indian passports, including proper lighting, background color, and dimensions.</p>
                
                <h2>Our Mission</h2>
                <p>Our mission is to simplify the passport photo process for everyone. We believe that getting a passport photo should be quick, easy, and affordable.</p>
